        <p>
         Netball has been a lifelong passion for me since childhood. I fondly remember following my sister to the gym then came back and created my own ball using plastics so that I can have a ball to play with my peers, pretending to be a superstar around my peers. As I grew, my love for the game strengthened. While I never pursued it professionally, netball remains a cherished hobby, offering moments of joy and excitement, serving as an escape from the everyday grind. Whether playing with friends or watching major matches on TV, netball holds a special place in my heart.
